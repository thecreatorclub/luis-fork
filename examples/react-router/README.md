# LUIS

This example showcases the LUIS setup rendering in a custom route.

To start your app simply run:

```
yarn start
```

- Visit: `http://localhost:3000` and you will see your app.
- Visit: `http://localhost:3000/luis` and you will see your friendly Luis interface.

# Important

Note that we code-splitted the Luis using `import()` not to bundle Luis into app.
